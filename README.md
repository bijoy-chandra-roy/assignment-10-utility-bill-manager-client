## Description
UtilityHub is a MERN Stack-based web application designed to simplify the management of monthly utility bills such as Electricity, Gas, Water, and Internet. Users can securely log in via Firebase (Email/Password or Google) to access protected routes. The application features a smart payment system that strictly restricts bill payments to the current month only. Logged-in users can manage their personal dashboard, update payment details, and delete records, with all data persisting in MongoDB. Key features include a real-time search and filter functionality, a persistent dark/light mode toggle, and the ability to download a detailed PDF report of payment history. The UI is fully responsive and utilizes SweetAlert2 to provide instant feedback for all user interactions.
